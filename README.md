# SQL-RockbusterStealthProject
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is facing stiff competition from other streaming services and in an attempt to use our existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive, we can look at data-driven analysis of the company's performance  over the course of the years 2005 - 2006.
The size of the dataset is 4MB and is in the .tar file format. I started by creating the data dictionary and extracting the identity relationship. After cleaning and sorting the dataset, I wrote multiple SQL queries to create a data profile of summary statistics, filter and order data and join tables and write subqueries and CTEs to answer key business questions and objectives.
